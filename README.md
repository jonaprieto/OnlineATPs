# OnlineATPs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonaprieto/online-atps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonaprieto/online-atps) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/65866897.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/65866897)

  OnlineATPs is a command-line client for
  [TPTP World](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTP).
  We can use an online [ATP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/OverviewOfATP.html)
  as it would be running locally. Indeed, SystemOnTPTP has available more than
  forty automatic theorem provers and we take avantage of all.


#### Requirements

* OnlineATPs has been built and tested using [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) 8.6.5. Please, check your version with:

````bash
$ ghc --version
````

* Use the last version of [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/). OnlineATPs has been installed successfully using `cabal-1.22` and `cabal-1.24`.

````bash
$ cabal update
$ cabal install cabal-install
$ cabal --version
````

#### Installation

````bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jonaprieto/online-atps.git
$ cd online-atps
$ cabal install
````

#### Usage

* To take advantage of OnlineATPs, we recommend check first
[SystemOnTPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTP) to see what is about.

* The user provide a problem formatted using
[TPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/QuickGuide/) syntax. Also, specify at least one ATP name. Then, execute online-atps to get an output, as we can see this output is pretty similar to the answer given by a local ATP but more verbose. Let see.

    * For instance, a TPTP problem looks similar to:

    ````bash
    $ cat basic.tptp
    fof(a1, axiom, a).
    fof(a2, axiom, b).
    fof(a3, axiom, (a & b) => z).
    fof(a4, conjecture, z).

    ````


    * Using the option `--atp` we specify the ATP. For instance, using `--atp=vampire` we specify that we are going to use [Vampire](http://www.vprover.org) ATP against the problem.

* See all ATPs available. Run this command:

````bash
$ online-atps --list-atps
````

* Check the `help` command to see all options of `online-atps`:

````bash
$ online-atps --help
````

* OnlineATPs accepts a name for a ATP using the prefix "online-" or not (e.g "vampire" or "online-vampire")

````bash
$ online-atps basic.tptp --atp=online-metis
````

* Check if a problem states a theorem or not using `--only-check`

````bash
$ online-atps basic.tptp --atp=online-metis --only-check
````
